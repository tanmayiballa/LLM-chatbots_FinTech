    "    We continue to evolve our business to a leading diversified specialty biopharma company. The evolution was accelerated as a result of the diabetes business divestiture and continued focus on certain therapeutic areas, including immuno-oncology. The following provides a brief summary of certain key events in 2014 ,as discussed in more detail throughout this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Opdivo was approved in the U.S. and Japan for unresectable or metastatic melanoma, and we announced positive results from certain other studies in melanoma, lung, Hodgkin Lymphoma and renal cell carcinoma. Several clinical collaborations were also entered into by us to seek opportunities to strategically combine Opdivo with other targeted agents in more than a dozen tumor types. Eliquis obtained an important label extension in 2014. We received regulatory approvals for our Hepatitis C Franchise, including Daklinza in the EU and our dual regimen of Daklinza and Sunvepra in Japan. Several business development transactions were completed in 2014, to advance our pipeline in other therapeutic areas, including fibrosis and genetically defined diseases. We are also expanding our biologics manufacturing capacity at Devens, Massachusetts and announced plans to build a new facility in Ireland.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Our revenues decreased by 3% in 2014 as a result of the diabetes business divestiture, exclusivity losses and expiration of rights partially offset by higher sales of key products, including recently launched products in certain markets. Our focus to optimize global brands and key markets accelerated growth of several key products. Eliquis sales increased in 2014 by $628 million following its global launch in 2013. Yervoy sales increased by 36%, or $348 million, from continued penetration in the U.S. community-based setting and first line indication and improved access internationally. Hepatitis C Franchise sales were $256 million following launches in Japan and certain EU countries. We expect these products will continue to grow in 2015 along with Orencia, Sprycel and recently launched Opdivo which will partially offset revenue reductions resulting from the expiration of certain rights pertaining to Abilify* in the U.S., royalty and alliance agreements, exclusivity losses for Baraclude in the U.S. and changes in foreign currency rates.\n",
